# Grocery-Store-Consumer-Behavior

The objective of this project was to assume the role of a marketing consultant and produce data-driven insights to help a brand improve the customer experience. 
My group decided to analyze the Grocery Store Industry, and ultimately provide recommendations for a brand to create a competitive advantage for customers with children.

We first used Python and R to clean and visualize the data, and then used Python to analyze it. The analysis stage consisted of three parts: [predictive modeling](https://github.com/jonathan-eman/Grocery-Store-Consumer-Behavior/blob/main/predictive-modeling.py), clustering (for customers that are [parents](https://github.com/jonathan-eman/Grocery-Store-Consumer-Behavior/blob/main/clustering-parents.py) and [non-parents](https://github.com/jonathan-eman/Grocery-Store-Consumer-Behavior/blob/main/clustering-non-parents.py)) and [association rule mining](https://github.com/jonathan-eman/Grocery-Store-Consumer-Behavior/blob/main/association-rule-mining.py). 

In this repo, you will find our code for each of the three analytical methods, the data files, and the [slide deck](https://github.com/jonathan-eman/Grocery-Store-Consumer-Behavior/blob/main/Grocery%20Store%20Consumer%20Behavior.pdf) summarizing our insights and strategic recommendations.
The analysis process, insights and recommendations can be generalized to real grocery store brands. 

This project uses the [Customer Personality Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis) dataset, which is intended to simulate the tendencies of real grocery store customers for academic purposes.
