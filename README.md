# Grocery-Store-Consumer-Behavior

The objective of this project was to assume the role of a marketing consultant and produce data-driven insights to help a brand improve the customer experience. 
My group decided to analyze the Grocery Store Industry, and ultimately provide recommendations for a brand to create a competitive advantage for customers with children.

We first used Python and R to clean and visualize the data, and then used Python to analyze it. The analysis stage consisted of three parts: predictive modeling, clustering and association rule mining. 

In this repo, you will find our code for each of the three analytical methods, the data files, and the slide deck summarizing our insights and strategic recommendations.
The analysis process, insights and recommendations can be generalized to real grocery store brands. 

This project uses the [Customer Personality Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis) dataset, which is intended to simulate the tendencies of real grocery store customers for academic purposes.
